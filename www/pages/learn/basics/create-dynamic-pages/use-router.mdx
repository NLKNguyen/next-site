## useRouter

As you can see, [useRouter](https://nextjs.org/docs#use-router) and [withRouter](http://localhost:3000/docs#using-a-higher-order-component) do the same, the difference remains in that `useRouter` is the recommended solution while working with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and `withRouter` is a [High Order Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html). Both add the `router` object to a component and both work in any component.

In the following example you can see `useRouter` being added to a component other than the exported page:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import Layout from '../components/MyLayout.js';

const Content = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{router.query.title}</h1>
      <p>This is the blog post content.</p>
    </>
  );
};

const Page = () => (
  <Layout>
    <Content />
  </Layout>
);

export default Page;
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
